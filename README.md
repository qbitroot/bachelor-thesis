# Protocol fuzzing

Code: [webtransport-fuzzer](https://github.com/qbitroot/webtransport-fuzzer)

Protocol fuzzing is a technique used to test protocol implementations. It has been successfully employed to identify implementation errors and security vulnerabilities in various protocols. The goal of this thesis is to explore methods of protocol fuzzing and apply them to real-world implementations of the WebTransport protocol. The results will be analyzed and discussed.
